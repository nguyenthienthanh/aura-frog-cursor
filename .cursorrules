# See .cursor/workflows/ for workflow phase definitions

# See .cursor/commands/ for all 45 available commands

# Commands: When user mentions a command or requests operations, read the corresponding

# file from .cursor/commands/ and execute according to its instructions.

# ============================================================================

# CRITICAL RULES

# ============================================================================

# 1. LIBRARY-SPECIFIC RULES (CRITICAL)

# - This is a COMPONENT LIBRARY, not an app

# - Components must be reusable and well-documented

# - Export all public APIs from src/index.ts

# - Use BaseProps pattern for common props

# - Support theme switching (light/dark) via MintContext

# - Test components via Storybook in demo/ app

# - Build library before testing: yarn build

# See .cursor/contexts/react-native-mint-ui/conventions.md

# 2. CODE QUALITY (ENFORCED)

# - TypeScript strict mode (zero errors)

# - ESLint must pass with zero errors

# - Prettier auto-formatting

# - Library allows `any` types for flexibility (noImplicitAny: false)

# - No non-null assertions (handle nullish values properly)

# See .cursor/rules/code-quality.md

# 3. PROJECT CONVENTIONS (MANDATORY)

# - Load project context from .cursor/contexts/react-native-mint-ui/ FIRST

# - Follow React Native and TypeScript conventions

# - Use component-based architecture (not feature-based)

# - PascalCase for React components, camelCase for utilities

# - Use relative imports within library

# - Export props interfaces alongside components

# See .cursor/contexts/react-native-mint-ui/conventions.md

# 4. COMPONENT DESIGN RULES (LIBRARY-SPECIFIC)

# - Extend BaseProps for common props (Theme, Color, SideComponents, Text)

# - Use MintContext for theme and global state

# - Always use StyleSheet.create for styles (performance)

# - Use React.memo for component optimization

# - Support both legacy and revamp themes

# - Document props with JSDoc comments

# - Mark deprecated props with @deprecated

# See .cursor/contexts/react-native-mint-ui/rules.md

# 5. TESTING APPROACH (LIBRARY-SPECIFIC)

# - No unit tests in library (tested via Storybook and demo app)

# - Create Storybook stories for each component

# - Test all component variants in stories

# - Test theme switching (light/dark)

# - Test responsive behavior

# - Build library before testing: yarn build-demo

# 6. APPROVAL GATES

# - Human approval required at each phase

# - No auto-progression

# See .cursor/rules/approval-gates.md

# IMPORTANT NOTES

# ============================================================================

# - Always load project context FIRST before starting any task

# - This is a LIBRARY project, not an app

# - Components must be reusable and well-documented

# - Test via Storybook in demo/ app, not unit tests

# - Build library before testing: yarn build or yarn build-demo

# - ESLint must pass with zero errors

# - Follow React Native, TypeScript, and project conventions

# - Get approval at each phase gate

# - Agents automatically use relevant skills from .cursor/skills/
