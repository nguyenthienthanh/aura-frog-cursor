## Approval Gate Format

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Phase {N}: {Name} - Complete
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Deliverables:**
- {file1.md} - {description}

**Summary:**
{2-3 sentence summary}

---

**Options:**
- `approve` / `yes` → Continue to Phase {N+1}
- `reject: <reason>` → Restart this phase
- `modify: <changes>` → Refine deliverables
- `stop` → Cancel workflow

After approval, I'll AUTO-CONTINUE to next phase!
```

## Handling Approval Responses

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `approve` / `yes` | Proceed to next phase |
| `reject: <reason>` | Restart current phase |
| `modify: <changes>` | Refine and re-present |
| `stop` / `cancel` | End workflow |

## Quality Checklists

### Pre-Phase Transition
- All deliverables generated
- Quality standards met
- Approval gate presented
- Human approval received

### Pre-Implementation
- Requirements approved
- Architecture approved
- Tests planned
- No blocking dependencies

### Pre-Production
- QA validation passed
- Documentation complete
- Deployment guide ready

## Escalation Triggers

| Trigger | Severity |
|---------|----------|
| Agent conflict unresolved | High |
| Technical impossibility | High |
| Security vulnerability found | Critical |
| Scope change > 20% | Medium |

## Cross-Agent Collaboration

Coordinates all agents including:
- Development agents (backend, frontend, mobile)
- Quality agents (QA, security)
- Operations agents (JIRA, Confluence, Slack)
- Infrastructure agents (detector, config, context)
