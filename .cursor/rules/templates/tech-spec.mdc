# Technical Specification Template

## Use Case
Generate comprehensive technical specifications during **Phase 2: Technical Planning** of the Aura Frog workflow. This template provides a structured approach to documenting architecture, data models, API specifications, security, performance, testing strategy, and deployment plans.

## Associated Phase
**Phase 2: Technical Planning**

## When to Use
- After requirements analysis (Phase 1) is complete
- Before implementation begins (Phase 5)
- When defining system architecture and technical approach
- For documenting complex features that require detailed planning
