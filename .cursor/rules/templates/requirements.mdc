# Requirements Document Template

## Use Case
Generate requirements documentation during **Phase 1: Requirements Analysis** of the Aura Frog workflow. This template structures the analysis of user needs, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and success criteria.

## Associated Phase
**Phase 1: Requirements Analysis (Understand)**

## When to Use
- At the beginning of any workflow
- When analyzing JIRA tickets or user requests
- Before technical planning begins
- To document scope and acceptance criteria

## Template Structure

```markdown

## User Stories

### US-001: As a [user type]
**I want to** [action]
**So that** [benefit]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1

## Dependencies

**API Endpoints:**
- GET /api/resource
- POST /api/resource

**Third-party Services:**

- Payment gateway

**Prerequisites:**
- User must be logged in
- Feature flag enabled

## Assumptions

- Assumption 1: Users have modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Assumption 2: API endpoints are already implemented
- Assumption 3: Design mockups are available

---

## Constraints

- Constraint 1: Must work offline (with limited functionality)

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| API rate limiting | HIGH | MEDIUM | Implement request queue and caching |
| Third-party service downtime | MEDIUM | LOW | Add fallback mechanisms |
| Browser compatibility issues | LOW | MEDIUM | Comprehensive cross-browser testing |

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] 85%+ test coverage achieved
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Zero critical bugs
- [ ] Stakeholder approval obtained

**Breakdown:**
- Phase 1 (Understand): [0.5] points
- Phase 2 (Design): [1-2] points
- Phase 3 (UI Breakdown): [0.5-1] points
- Phase 4 (Plan Tests): [0.5-1] points
- Phase 5a (Write Tests): [1-3] points
- Phase 5b (Implementation): [2-8] points
- Phase 5c (Refactor): [0.5-2] points
- Phase 6 (Code Review): [0.25] points
- Phase 7 (QA Verification): [0.25-1] points
- Phase 8 (Documentation): [0.5-1] points
- Phase 9 (Share): [0] points (automated)

### Time Estimate
**Range:** [Y-Z] hours (~[W] days)

**Breakdown:**
- Optimistic: [Y] hours
- Most Likely: [Y+X] hours
- Pessimistic: [Z] hours

### Confidence Level
**Level:** [High / Medium / Low]

**Reasoning:**
- Requirements clarity: [High/Medium/Low]
- Technical familiarity: [High/Medium/Low]
- Dependencies: [None/Few/Many]
- Unknowns: [None/Some/Many]

### Effort Components
- **Effort (40%):** How much work? How many files?
- **Complexity (30%):** How hard is the logic? Edge cases?
- **Uncertainty (20%):** How many unknowns? Familiar tech?
- **Risk (10%):** What can go wrong? How critical?
```

## Sections Explained

### Overview
Brief summary of what's being built and why it matters to the business.

### Functional Requirements
Specific features and capabilities the system must provide. Each requirement has:
- Unique ID (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
- Clear description
- Priority level
- Testable acceptance criteria

### Non-Functional Requirements
Quality attributes like performance, security, usability, reliability. These define "how well" the system should work, not just "what" it should do.

### User Stories
User-centered descriptions of functionality in the format "As a [user], I want [action] so that [benefit]."

### Dependencies
External factors the feature depends on - APIs, services, other features.

### Assumptions
Things we're assuming to be true for planning purposes.

### Constraints
Limitations or restrictions on the solution.

### Risks
Potential issues that could impact delivery, with mitigation strategies.

### Success Criteria
Clear, measurable criteria for determining if the feature is successful.

### Initial Estimation
Story points, time estimate, and confidence level using standard Agile estimation techniques.

## Project Customization

Reference project-specific information:
- **Acceptance criteria format:** `.cursor/project-contexts/[project]/conventions.md`
- **Estimation guidelines:** `.cursor/project-contexts/[project]/examples.md`
- **Story point reference:** `docs/STORY_POINTS_GUIDE.md`

## Related Templates
- `tech-spec.mdc` - Phase 2, uses requirements as input
- `test-plan.mdc` - Phase 4, derives tests from requirements
- `confluence-page.mdc` - Phase 8, summarizes requirements and implementation

## Tips for Usage

1. **Start Broad, Then Specific:** Begin with overview, then drill into details
2. **Make It Testable:** Every requirement should have clear acceptance criteria
3. **Prioritize Ruthlessly:** Not everything is HIGH priority
4. **Identify Risks Early:** Better to know risks upfront than discover them later
5. **Be Realistic with Estimates:** Use historical data where available
6. **Get Stakeholder Input:** Validate requirements with PM, Design, QA
