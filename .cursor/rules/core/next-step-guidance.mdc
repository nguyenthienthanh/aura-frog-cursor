# Next Step Guidance

**Every response MUST end with a "What's Next" section.** User should never guess what to do.

## Format

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHAT'S NEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Quick Actions:
- `approve` / `yes` - Continue
- `reject: <reason>` - Redo
Available Commands:
- `workflow:status` - Progress
- `workflow:handoff` - Save & handoff
Suggestion: → Type `approve` to continue
```

## Context-Aware Options

- **Planning (1-4):** approve, reject, skip phase-3 (backend-only)
- **Implementation (5):** continue, tests:run, skip refactor
- **Review (6-9):** approve, fix: issue, done

## Minimal Format (mid-phase)

```
**Next:** `approve` to continue | `reject: <feedback>` to revise
```
