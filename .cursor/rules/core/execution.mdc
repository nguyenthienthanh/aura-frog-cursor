# Execution Rules

## ALWAYS Do

1. Show agent banner at START of every response
2. Load project context from `.cursor/project-contexts/`
3. Detect appropriate agent based on task
4. Read command definitions from `.cursor/commands/`
5. Follow phase order (phases build on each other)
6. Generate deliverables at each phase
7. Save workflow state to `.cursor/workflow-contexts/`

### Approval Phases (Phase 2 & 5b only)
- Show approval gate, wait for explicit approval

### Auto-Continue Phases (1, 3, 4, 5a, 5c, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- Execute fully, show deliverables, continue automatically
- Auto-stop on blockers (test failures, security issues)

## NEVER Do

- Skip project context loading
- Ignore approval gates at Phase 2 & 5b
- Skip auto-continue phases (must execute & show deliverables)
- Implement without tests (TDD mandatory)
- Skip RED phase in TDD
- Commit credentials/tokens
- Push to main/master without approval
- Write to external systems without confirmation
- Continue when tests fail or coverage below target

## Blocking Conditions (STOP immediately)

- User rejection ("reject", "stop", "cancel")
- Tests failing in GREEN phase
- Coverage below target
- Security vulnerabilities detected
- Token limit approaching (150K warning)

## Priority Order

`.cursorrules` > `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` > Cursor defaults
