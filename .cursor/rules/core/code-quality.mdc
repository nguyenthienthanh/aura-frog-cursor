# Code Quality Rules

## Project Rules

Project rules from `.cursor/project-contexts/[project]/` are MERGED with these defaults. Project wins on conflicts.

## TypeScript Standards

- Strict typing, no `any`
- No non-null assertions (`!`), use `??` or guards
- Proper error handling (catch specific errors, never silently swallow)

## Testing

| Scope | Minimum Coverage |
|-------|-----------------|
| Overall | 80% |
| Critical business logic | 90% |
| UI components | 70% |
| Utility functions | 95% |

Use Arrange/Act/Assert pattern. Descriptive test names in `describe`/`it` blocks.

## Naming

- Variables/functions: `camelCase`
- Components: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Booleans: `is/has/can/should` prefix
- Event handlers: `handle` + Event

## Code Smells

- No magic numbers (use named constants)
- No functions >50 lines (break into smaller)
- No deep nesting (use early returns)
- No `console.log` in production (use logger)

## Before Submitting

- Linter passes
- TypeScript strict compliance
- Tests pass with coverage >= threshold
- Proper error handling
- Readable, follows project conventions
