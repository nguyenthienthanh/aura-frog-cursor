# Safety Rules - External System Interactions

**Purpose:** Prevent accidental writes to external systems

## Core Safety Principles

### 1. Always Confirm Before Writing

**Rule:** NEVER write to external systems without explicit user confirmation

**Applies to:**
- JIRA (status updates, comments, subtasks)
- Confluence (page creation, updates)
- Slack (notifications)
- Git (commits, pushes)

## Confirmation Required

### Git Operations
```markdown
⚠️ **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED: Git Commit**

**Files to commit:** 5 files
- src/features/sharing/ShareModal.tsx
- src/features/sharing/ShareModal.test.tsx

**Commit message:**
feat(sharing): implement social media sharing

**Type "confirm" to proceed**
```

## No Confirmation Needed (Read-Only)

Safe operations that don't modify data:
- ✅ Fetch JIRA tickets
- ✅ Read Confluence pages
- ✅ Git status, log, diff
- ✅ Send informational notifications

## Forbidden Operations

### Never Auto-Execute:
- ❌ Delete JIRA tickets
- ❌ Force push to Git
- ❌ Delete Git branches
- ❌ Modify production data
- ❌ Run database migrations in production

## Security Rules

### API Keys & Tokens
```yaml
Storage:
  ✅ Environment variables
  ✅ .envrc (with direnv)
  ❌ Never in code
  ❌ Never in git

Access:
  ✅ Read from process.env
  ✅ Masked in logs
  ❌ Never log full tokens
```

### Sensitive Data
```yaml
Never log or expose:
  - API tokens
  - Passwords
  - Private keys
  - User PII
  - Database credentials
```

## Error Handling

### Failed Operations
```typescript
try {
  await externalApi.update(data);
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('External API update failed', {
    // Don't log token or sensitive data
  });

  showError('Operation failed. Please try again or update manually.');
}
```

## Checklist Before External Write

- [ ] User explicitly requested this action
- [ ] Confirmation prompt shown
- [ ] User confirmed (typed "confirm")
- [ ] Operation is safe (no destructive action)
- [ ] Sensitive data redacted from logs
- [ ] Audit log entry created
- [ ] Error handling in place
- [ ] User notified of result

## Emergency Stop

User Can Always Stop:
```
User types: "stop", "cancel", "abort"
→ Immediately halt all operations
→ Rollback pending changes
→ Return to safe state
```
