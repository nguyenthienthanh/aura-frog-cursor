# Safety Rules

## Core: NEVER write to external systems without user confirmation

**Requires confirmation:** Git commits/pushes, JIRA updates, Confluence writes, Slack notifications, database modifications.

**No confirmation needed (read-only):** Fetch JIRA tickets, read Confluence, git status/log/diff, read APIs.

**Forbidden (NEVER auto-execute):** Delete JIRA tickets, force push, delete branches, modify production data, run production migrations.

## Security

- Store secrets in environment variables / `.envrc` only
- NEVER commit secrets to git
- NEVER log API tokens, passwords, private keys, PII
- Mask sensitive data in all output

## Emergency Stop

User types "stop", "cancel", "abort" → Immediately halt all operations, rollback pending changes.

## Approval Gates

Only 2 gates: Phase 2 (Design) and Phase 5b (Implementation). All other phases auto-continue with deliverable display.
