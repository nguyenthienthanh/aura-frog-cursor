# Context Management

**Purpose:** Optimize token usage and context efficiency to reduce costs and improve reasoning quality. Less noise = better focus.

## Core Principles

### 1. Minimal Initial Context

| Tier | Tokens | Loads |
|------|--------|-------|
| 0-always | ~500 | Banner format + MCP list + core rules |
| 1-session | ~1000 | Project detection + tech stack + workflow phase |
| 2-demand | variable | Framework patterns + detailed rules + full skills |

**Rule:** Start with Tier 0+1. Load Tier 2 only when task requires it.

### 2. Progressive Loading

| Trigger | Action | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Framework task detected | Load framework bundle | Needed for implementation |
| Security concern mentioned | Load security rules | Safety critical |
| Test task requested | Load test patterns | Quality assurance |
| Design task detected | Load design systems | UI consistency |

**Don't:** Load all framework expert skills at session start.
**Do:** Load only the detected framework's patterns when needed.

### 3. Context Cleanup

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Task completed | /clear if switching domains |
| Context >80% | /compact with focus instructions |
| Switching tech stack | Clear framework-specific context |
| Error spiral (3+ failed attempts) | /clear and restart fresh |

---

## Model Selection Guidelines

| Task Type | Recommended Model | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Typo/formatting | Haiku | No deep reasoning needed |
| Bug fixes | Sonnet | Balance of speed and quality |
| New features | Sonnet | Standard implementation |
| Architecture | Opus | Needs deep reasoning |
| Security audit | Opus | Safety critical |
| Refactoring | Sonnet/Opus | Depends on scope |

---

## Token Budget Awareness

### Track Usage

The status bar shows token percentage. Act on these thresholds:

| Percent | Action | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| <50% | Continue normally | Plenty of context remaining |
| 50-70% | Consider /compact | Preserve important context |
| 70-85% | Use /compact now | "Focus on [task details]" |
| >85% | Finish task then /clear | Prevent mid-task compaction |

### Compact Instructions

When using /compact, provide focus:

```bash
# Good - specific focus
/compact Focus on the auth module implementation and test failures

# Bad - no guidance
/compact
```

---

## Efficient Exploration

### Use Subagents for Verbose Tasks

| Task | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Run full test suite | Keep verbose output out of main context |
| Fetch large documentation | Summarize before returning |
| Explore unfamiliar codebase | Agent returns summary only |
| Generate coverage report | Return metrics not full output |
| Lint entire project | Return issue count not all warnings |

**Pattern:** Verbose output stays in subagent. Summary returns to main.

### Targeted File Reading

| Do | Don't | Reason |
|----|-------|--------|
| Read specific functions | Read entire large files | Reduce noise |
| Use line ranges | Read 1000+ line files fully | Focus on relevant |
| Grep then read matches | Read all files to find pattern | Efficient search |
| Cache detection results | Re-scan project each task | Use project cache |

---

## Session Boundaries

### When to /clear

| Trigger | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Switching projects | Different tech stack and context |
| Switching domains (frontend to backend) | Different patterns needed |
| After major task completion | Fresh context for next task |
| Context feels cluttered | Quality of responses degrading |
| After architectural discussion | Implementation needs clean start |

### When NOT to /clear

- Mid-implementation (lose context)
- During debugging (need history)
- Multi-file refactor in progress

---

## Skill Loading Optimization

### Current (Expensive)
```
Session start -> Load 12 framework skills -> 6000+ tokens used
```

### Optimized (Efficient)
```
Session start -> Load framework-expert bundle -> Detect tech -> Load only needed patterns -> 500-1000 tokens
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Load all skills at start | Wastes 5000+ tokens | Use lazy loading |
| Read entire codebase | Overwhelms context | Targeted exploration |
| Never use /clear | Stale context degrades quality | Clear between tasks |
| Ignore token warnings | Mid-task compaction loses context | Act at 70% |
| Always use Opus | 15x cost for trivial tasks | Use model router |

---

## Team Context Management (Agent Teams)

**When:** Agent teams are enabled with multiple AI instances.

### Key Differences

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| No shared history | Teammates do NOT see the lead's conversation history |
| Explicit context passing | Lead must send all relevant context via messages or shared files |
| File-based sharing | Use shared task descriptions and file paths for context |
| Independent loading | Each teammate loads its own project context independently |

### Context Passing Best Practices

| Method | When | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| Task description | Creating tasks | Include file paths + requirements + constraints |
| Teammate message | Handoff or clarification | Send specific decisions/changes made |
| Shared files | Phase deliverables | Write to plan directory then reference path |
| Task dependencies | Sequential work | blockedBy ensures ordering |

### Anti-Patterns in Team Mode

| Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Assume teammate knows context | They have empty context | Include all relevant info in task/message |
| Send entire codebase as context | Overwhelms teammate context | Send only relevant file paths and summaries |
| Multiple teammates editing same file | Merge conflicts | Use file claiming conventions |

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Compact with focus
/compact Focus on [specific task details]

# Clear for fresh start
/clear

# Check project detection (avoid re-scanning)
/project:status
```
