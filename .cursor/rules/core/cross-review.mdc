# Cross-Review Workflow Rules

**Purpose:** Cross-review ensures quality by having multiple agents/perspectives review deliverables before proceeding

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis Review

### Reviewers
1. **Dev Agent(s)** - Technical feasibility
2. **QA Agent** - Testability and acceptance criteria
3. **UI Designer** - Design requirements (if UI involved)

### Dev Technical Review Checklist
- [ ] Requirements are technically achievable
- [ ] Technology stack is appropriate
- [ ] Integration points are clearly defined
- [ ] No conflicting requirements

### QA Testability Review Checklist
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are clearly defined
- [ ] Edge cases are documented
- [ ] Requirements are testable

## Phase 2: Technical Planning Review

### Reviewers
1. **Secondary Dev Agent(s)** - Architecture review
2. **QA Agent** - Test planning feasibility

### Architecture Quality Checklist
- [ ] Architecture is sound
- [ ] Design patterns are appropriate
- [ ] Component structure is logical
- [ ] State management approach is correct

### Testability Assessment
- [ ] Components are testable
- [ ] Test isolation is possible
- [ ] Mocking strategy is clear
- [ ] Coverage target is achievable

## Phase 4: Test Plan Review

### Reviewers
1. **Dev Agent(s)** - Implementation feasibility

### Test Plan Feasibility Checklist
- [ ] Test cases match technical implementation
- [ ] Test scenarios are comprehensive
- [ ] Edge cases are covered
- [ ] Tests can be written as planned (TDD)

## Cross-Review Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- ✅ Be constructive and specific
- ✅ Focus on quality, not perfection
- ✅ Provide alternatives, not just criticism
- ✅ Ask questions for clarification
- ✅ Acknowledge good decisions

### Don'ts ❌
- ❌ Nitpick minor style issues
- ❌ Reject without explanation
- ❌ Take too long to review
- ❌ Skip the review process
- ❌ Be overly critical

## Escalation Process

### When Reviews Conflict

If reviewers disagree:
1. Facilitate discussion
2. Explain perspectives
3. Discuss trade-offs
4. Make informed decision

## Timeline Impact

| Phase | Without Review | With Review | Time Added |
|-------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Phase 1 | 45 min | 70 min | +25 min |
| Phase 2 | 90 min | 115 min | +25 min |
| Phase 4 | 60 min | 75 min | +15 min |

**Total added time:** ~65 minutes
**Quality improvement:** Significant
