# Verification Rule

**Purpose:** Ensure all completion claims are backed by fresh verification evidence. No guessing.

## Iron Law

**NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE**

1. Run the command
2. Read the output
3. THEN claim the result

## Wrong vs Right

### Wrong

```
"I've fixed the bug. It should work now."
"Tests should be passing."
"That should resolve the issue."
```

### Right

```
"Tests pass:

  PASS src/auth/login.test.ts
  - validates email (5ms)
  - rejects invalid password (3ms)

  Tests: 2 passed, 2 total"
```

## Verification Commands

| Stack | Command |
|-------|---------|
| JavaScript | npm test / yarn test |
| TypeScript | npx tsc --noEmit |
| Python | pytest |
| Go | go test ./... |
| PHP | php artisan test |
| Build | npm run build |

---

## When to Verify

- After applying fix
- Before claiming "done"
- After refactoring
- Before commit
- After merge

---

## Red Flags

Stop and verify if about to say:

- "Should work now"
- "Seems fixed"
- "I think that's it"
- "Probably passing"

All require: **Run -> Read -> Report**
