# KISS Principle & Avoid Over-Engineering

**Version:** 1.12.0

**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - Always choose the simplest solution that solves the problem. Avoid over-engineering by adding unnecessary complexity, premature optimization, or excessive abstraction.

## Core Principles

### 1. Simple > Complex

```typescript
// BAD: Abstract factory pattern for 2 buttons
class ButtonFactory { private static instance: ButtonFactory; /* ... */ }

// GOOD: Just use props
function Button({ variant = 'primary', children, ...props }: ButtonProps) {
  return <button className={`btn btn--${variant}`} {...props}>{children}</button>
}
```

### 2. Solve Today's Problem, Not Tomorrow's Maybe-Problem

```typescript
// BAD: Planning for features that don't exist yet
interface DataStore {
  get(key: string): Promise<any>
  set(key: string, value: any): Promise<void>
  transaction(callback: (store: DataStore) => Promise<void>): Promise<void>
}

// GOOD: Solve the actual requirement
const preferences = {
  get: (key: string) => localStorage.getItem(key),
  set: (key: string, value: string) => localStorage.setItem(key, value)
}
```

### 3. Composition > Inheritance

Use hooks/composition instead of deep inheritance hierarchies.

### 4. Rule of Three (DRY with Caution)

Do not abstract prematurely. Wait for real duplication before extracting:
- **1st time**: Write it inline.
- **2nd time**: Duplicate it (note the similarity).
- **3rd time**: Now refactor into a shared function/component.

### 5. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

Do not build features, abstractions, or "just in case" code for imaginary future requirements.
If no current user story or task demands it, leave it out. You can always add it later when the need is real.

## When to Add Complexity

**Valid reasons only:**
1. **Rule of Three** - Pattern repeated 3+ times
2. **Measured performance problem** - Profile first, then optimize
3. **Clear business requirement** - e.g., "support 5 payment gateways"

## Review Checklist

Before adding complexity, ask:
- [ ] Is this solving a CURRENT problem?
- [ ] Have I tried the simplest solution first?
- [ ] Can I explain this to a junior dev in 2 minutes?
- [ ] Have I seen this pattern 3+ times?

If 3+ answers are "No" -> probably over-engineering.
