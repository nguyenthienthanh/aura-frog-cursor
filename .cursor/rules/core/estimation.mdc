# Estimation Guide

**Purpose:** Estimate tasks using story points, time, and risk assessment for accurate planning.

## Story Points (Fibonacci)

| Points | Complexity | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Trivial | Typo fix / config change |
| 2 | Simple | Single function / minor UI tweak |
| 3 | Small | New component / API endpoint |
| 5 | Medium | Feature with multiple files / integration |
| 8 | Large | Cross-cutting feature / refactor |
| 13 | Very Large | New module / architecture change |
| 21 | Epic | Major feature / needs breakdown |

**Rule:** If >13, break into smaller tasks.

## Time Estimates

| Points | Solo Dev | With Review |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | 1-2 hours | 2-4 hours |
| 2 | 2-4 hours | 4-6 hours |
| 3 | 4-8 hours | 1 day |
| 5 | 1-2 days | 2-3 days |
| 8 | 2-4 days | 3-5 days |
| 13 | 1 week | 1-2 weeks |
| 21 | 2+ weeks | Break down first |

**Includes:** Development + testing + code review

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Levels

| Level | Impact | Probability | Action |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Low | Minor | Unlikely | Proceed |
| Medium | Moderate | Possible | Monitor |
| High | Significant | Likely | Mitigate |
| Critical | Severe | Expected | Block until resolved |

### Common Risks

| Risk | Indicators | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Technical | New tech / complex logic | Spike/POC first |
| Scope creep | Vague requirements | Clarify before start |
| Dependencies | External APIs / other teams | Identify early / mock |
| Breaking changes | Shared code / public API | Feature flag / versioning |
| Performance | Large data / real-time | Load test early |
| Security | Auth / user data / payments | Security review |

## Quick Estimation Template

```markdown
## Estimate: [Task Name]

**Story Points:** [1/2/3/5/8/13]
**Time:** [X hours/days]
**Confidence:** [High/Medium/Low]

### Risks
| Risk | Level | Mitigation |
|------|-------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | Medium | [Action] |

### Assumptions
- [Assumption 1]
- [Assumption 2]
```

## Estimation Factors

Weight these when estimating:

| Factor | Weight | Questions |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Scope | 40% | How many files? Clear requirements? |
| Complexity | 30% | New patterns? Edge cases? |
| Uncertainty | 20% | Familiar tech? Known unknowns? |
| Risk | 10% | What can break? Dependencies? |

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Avoid:**
- Padding estimates "just in case"
- Estimating without understanding scope
- Ignoring testing/review time
- >13 points without breakdown
- 0% confidence estimates

**Do:**
- Ask clarifying questions first
- Include all phases (dev + test + review)
- Flag high-risk items explicitly
- Break large tasks into 3-5 point chunks
- Re-estimate when scope changes
