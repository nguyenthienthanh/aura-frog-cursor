# MCP Startup Check

**Version:** 1.1.9
**Type:** Rule (Informational)

---

## At Session Start

When starting a new session, briefly verify MCP servers are available by checking:

```
Enabled MCP Servers (from .cursor/mcp.json):
- context7: Library documentation lookup
- playwright: Browser automation/testing
- filesystem: File operations
- memory: Persistent context storage
```

## Quick Verification

If unsure whether MCP servers loaded:

1. **Context7**: Try `resolve-library-id` for any library
2. **Playwright**: Check if browser automation tools are available
3. **Filesystem**: Check if file read/write tools beyond standard are available

## Troubleshooting

If MCP fails to load:
1. Check Cursor Settings → Features → MCP for status
2. Ensure `npx` is available in PATH
3. Check for npm/network issues
4. Restart Cursor if servers show as failed
