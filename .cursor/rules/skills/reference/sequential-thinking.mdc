# Sequential Thinking

**Type:** Reference Skill
**Use When:** Complex problems requiring structured analysis

---

## Core Pattern

```toon
thought_structure[5]{step,format,purpose}:
 1,Initial analysis,Understand the problem space
 2,Build on previous,Deepen understanding
 3,[REVISION],Correct earlier assumptions
 4,[BRANCH],Explore alternatives
 5,[FINAL],Synthesize solution
```

---

## Output Format

```
Thought 1/N: [Initial analysis of the problem]
  - Key observations
  - Initial assumptions

Thought 2/N: [Building on Thought 1]
  - Deeper analysis
  - Connections discovered

Thought 3/N [REVISION of Thought 1]: [Corrected understanding]
  - What was wrong
  - Corrected view

Thought 4/N [BRANCH A]: [Alternative approach]
  - Different angle
  - Trade-offs

Thought 5/N [FINAL]: [Solution synthesis]
  - Recommended approach
  - Key decisions
```

---

## Dynamic Adjustment

```toon
adjustment[3]{action,when,how}:
 Expand,Complexity increases,Add more thoughts (N+1)
 Contract,Simpler than expected,Skip to FINAL
 Branch,Multiple valid paths,Create BRANCH A/B/C
```

---

## When to Use

```toon
use_cases[5]{scenario,thoughts}:
 Architecture design,5-8
 Bug root cause,3-5
 Performance optimization,4-6
 Security analysis,5-7
 Refactoring strategy,4-6
```

---

## Phase Integration

```toon
phase_integration[4]{phase,use,focus}:
 Phase 1,Requirements analysis,Understand scope and constraints
 Phase 2,Technical planning,Evaluate approaches
 Phase 5b,Complex implementation,Debug tricky issues
 Phase 6,Code review,Deep analysis of changes
```

---

## Example

```
User: "The login is slow but I don't know why"

Thought 1/4: [Initial analysis]
  - Login involves: UI -> API -> Auth -> DB
  - "Slow" is vague - need metrics
  - Possible bottlenecks: network, DB, auth provider

Thought 2/4: [Building on observations]
  - Auth provider (external) is most likely
  - DB queries should be fast (indexed)

Thought 3/4 [REVISION of Thought 2]: [After checking logs]
  - Actually, DB query is taking 2.3s
  - Missing index on users.email

Thought 4/4 [FINAL]: [Solution]
  - Add index: CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email)
  - Expected improvement: 2.3s -> 50ms
  - Verify with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
```

**Invoke:** Use for problems requiring structured exploration before solution.
