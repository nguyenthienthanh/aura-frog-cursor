# Problem Solving Techniques

**Type:** Reference Skill
**Use When:** Stuck, need breakthrough, or evaluating approaches

---

## 5 Techniques

```toon
techniques[5]{name,when,approach}:
 Simplification Cascades,Complexity spiraling / 5+ attempts failed,Strip to minimal then rebuild
 Collision-Zone Thinking,Innovation blocks / need breakthrough,Combine unrelated concepts
 Meta-Pattern Recognition,Same issue across domains,Find underlying pattern
 Inversion Exercise,Forced into "only way" thinking,Ask "what if opposite?"
 Scale Game,Production readiness unclear,Test at 10x / 100x / 1000x
```

---

## 1. Simplification Cascades

**When:** Complexity spiraling, 5+ implementations tried

**Process:**
1. Remove ALL features except core
2. Make it work with hardcoded values
3. Add ONE thing back
4. Repeat until issue appears
5. Fix at that layer

**Example:**
```
Problem: Auth + caching + retry + logging all broken

1. Remove retry, logging, caching -> just auth
2. Auth works? Yes -> add caching
3. Caching breaks it -> found the issue
4. Fix caching layer
5. Re-add retry, logging
```

---

## 2. Collision-Zone Thinking

**When:** Need creative breakthrough, conventional approaches failed

**Process:**
1. List unrelated domains
2. Find principles from each
3. Combine into novel solution

**Example:**
```
Problem: Users abandoning checkout

Domains: Gaming + Psychology + Logistics
-> "Your items are reserved for 10 min" + progress indicator + "3 people viewing this"
```

---

## 3. Meta-Pattern Recognition

**When:** Same issue keeps appearing in different forms

**Process:**
1. List all similar issues
2. Find what they share
3. Fix the meta-pattern

**Example:**
```
Issues: Users/Orders/Products table queries all slow
Meta-pattern: All queries filter by date without index
Fix: Add date indexes to all tables
```

---

## 4. Inversion Exercise

**When:** Stuck in "only way" thinking

**Process:**
1. State current assumption
2. Ask: "What if the opposite?"
3. Explore inverted approach

**Example:**
```
Assumption: "We need to cache API responses"
Inversion: "What if we never cache?"
-> Discovers most data doesn't change
-> Solution: Cache-first with invalidation
```

---

## 5. Scale Game

**When:** Production readiness unclear

**Process:**
1. Test at 10x current load
2. Test at 100x
3. Test at 1000x
4. Find breaking point
5. Design for 10x actual need

**Example:**
```
Current: 100 users/day
- 1,000: Works fine
- 10,000: DB connection pool exhausted
- 100,000: Memory OOM
-> Fix: Connection pooling + memory optimization
```

## Decision Matrix

```toon
decision[5]{symptom,technique}:
 "Tried everything",Simplification Cascades
 "Need creative idea",Collision-Zone Thinking
 "Keeps happening",Meta-Pattern Recognition
 "No other way",Inversion Exercise
 "Will it scale?",Scale Game
```

---

## Quick Reference

```
Stuck            -> Simplify first
Creative block   -> Collision zones
Recurring issues -> Meta-patterns
Tunnel vision    -> Invert assumptions
Scaling fears    -> Scale game
```

---

**Invoke:** Use when conventional debugging fails or need breakthrough.
