# Workflow Fast-Track

**Type:** Auto-Invoke Skill
**Priority:** HIGH - Use when design/specs are already complete

---

## When to Use

**USE when user provides:**
- Complete design document
- Detailed tech specs
- API specifications
- Component breakdown
- Any pre-approved requirements

**DON'T use when:**
- Requirements are vague
- Design needs clarification
- User wants to discuss approach

---

## How to Invoke

```
fasttrack: [paste specs or path to specs file]
workflow:fasttrack <path-to-specs.md>
```

---

## Fast-Track Phases (4-9 Only)

```toon
phases[8]{phase,name,action,stop_condition}:
 4,Plan Tests,Auto-generate test strategy,Never
 5a,Write Tests (RED),Write failing tests,Tests pass (error!)
 5b,Build (GREEN),Implement to pass tests,Tests fail after 3 attempts
 5c,Polish (REFACTOR),Clean code,Tests break
 6,Review,Security + quality scan,Critical security issue
 7,Verify,Run all tests,Coverage <80%
 8,Document,Update docs,Never
 9,Share,Notify team,Never
```

---

## Spec Validation

Before starting, validate specs contain:

```toon
required_sections[6]{section,purpose}:
 Overview,What we're building
 Requirements,Functional requirements
 Technical Design,Architecture/approach
 API/Interfaces,Endpoints or component APIs
 Data Model,Database/state structure
 Acceptance Criteria,Definition of done
```

**If missing sections:** Ask user to provide them, don't start without.

---

## Execution Mode

```
STANDARD WORKFLOW:
Phase 4 -> Wait -> Phase 5a -> Wait -> Phase 5b -> ...

FAST-TRACK WORKFLOW:
Phase 4 -> Phase 5a -> Phase 5b -> Phase 5c -> Phase 6 -> Phase 7 -> Phase 8 -> Phase 9
(No stops unless error)
```

### Only Stop On

1. **Tests unexpectedly pass in Phase 5a** (RED phase)
2. **Tests fail after 3 implementation attempts** (GREEN phase)
3. **Critical security vulnerability found** (Phase 6)
4. **Coverage below 80%** (Phase 7)

---

## Critical Rules

- **TDD Still Applies:** RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR
- **KISS Still Applies:** No over-engineering, follow specs exactly
- **Quality Still Applies:** 80% coverage minimum, no critical security issues

---

## Comparison to Standard Workflow

```toon
workflow_modes[2]{mode,phases,approvals}:
 standard,1-9,8 gates (all phases)
 fasttrack,4-9,0 gates (errors only)
```

---

## Progress Reporting

Show condensed progress after each phase:

```markdown
FAST-TRACK Progress
Phase 4: Test Strategy (12 tests planned)
Phase 5a: Tests Written (12 failing)
Phase 5b: Implementing... (8/12 passing)
Phase 5c: Refactor
Phase 6: Review
Phase 7: Verify
Phase 8: Document
Phase 9: Notify
```
