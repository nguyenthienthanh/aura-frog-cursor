## Overview

Detect and simplify overly complex code. Apply KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid).

**Philosophy:** The best code is code you don't have to write. Less is more.

---

## Complexity Targets

```toon
targets[5]{metric,target}:
 Cyclomatic complexity,<=10
 Nesting depth,<=3
 Function length,<=30 lines
 File length,<=300 lines
 Parameters,<=3
```

---

## Quick Reference

```toon
signals[5]{signal,action}:
 Deep nesting (>3 levels),Flatten with early returns
 Long function (>30 lines),Extract smaller functions
 Complex conditionals,Use lookup tables
 Over-abstraction,Inline single-use code
 Premature optimization,Remove unless profiled
```

---

## Simplification Checklist

Before writing or reviewing code, ask:

1. **Can I delete this?** - Unused code, dead branches
2. **Can I inline this?** - Single-use abstractions
3. **Can I flatten this?** - Nested conditions, callbacks
4. **Can I use built-ins?** - Array methods, standard library
5. **Is this needed now?** - YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)
6. **Would a junior understand?** - If not, simplify

## Example Session

```
User: This function is too complex, simplify it

Claude: Let me analyze the complexity...

Complexity Analysis:
- Cyclomatic complexity: 15 (target: <=10)
- Nesting depth: 5 (target: <=3)
- Lines: 87 (target: <=30)

Simplification Plan:
1. Convert nested ifs to early returns (-3 nesting)
2. Extract validation logic to separate function (-20 lines)
3. Replace switch with lookup table (-15 lines, -5 complexity)
4. Remove unused error handling branch

Result:
- Cyclomatic complexity: 6
- Nesting depth: 2
- Lines: 28
```

**Remember:** Simple code is not dumb code. It takes skill to write simple code.
